windows vista inspired portfolio, I have no affiliation with Microsoft.
In order to add an app you must use the Window Component and pass it a 
react component of your own and give it a title as well. Then simply add
it to the applist array and add an icon and type of either desktop or startmenu.
Note: the app name must be the same as the title you pass into the window when making
the app.
